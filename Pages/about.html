I have a training in Hip-hop and was previously in K-pop dance crews called <i>Kollective</i> and <i>D-Krown</i>.</p> <p>My work focuses mostly on exploration and storytelling. I love to combine various elements from different practices to create unique and authentic pieces.I have a strong an interest in immersive experiences. My goal is to push the limits of immersive technologies by exploring the merge between traditional or performative disciplines with digital tools and techniques.</p>
